🌾 Crop Yield Analysis (Tableau Project)

📘 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive analysis of crop yields using Tableau. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights from agricultural data related to crop production across regions and years.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Tableau Desktop

1.Interactive dashboards

2.Geographic and time-series analysis

3.Filters and parameters for user interaction

Microsoft Excel / CSV (for initial data preparation)

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset includes historical agricultural data with fields such as:

Year, State / Region,Crop Name,Area Harvested,Production,Yield (kg/hectare)

📌 Data Source:  Kaggle 

🔍 Key Analysis Objectives
1.Understand crop yield trends over the years

2.Identify top-performing crops by production and yield

3.Compare crop performance across different regions

Analyze the relationship between area cultivated and total production

📊 Dashboard Features
The Tableau dashboard includes:

1.Interactive Filters: Year, State, Crop Type
2.Visualizations: Line graphs, bar charts, heat maps, geo-maps
3.KPIs: Total Production, Average Yield, Area Harvested

Trend Analysis: Crop performance over time

📈 Key Insights
1.Highlighted states with the highest and lowest crop yields

2.Observed steady improvement in yield for selected crops over years

3.Identified underperforming crops despite large cultivated areas

Detected seasonal or region-specific production trends
